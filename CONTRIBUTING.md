# How to contribute to *refuse*

Thank you for considering contributing to *refuse*!
**Contributions are highly welcomed!**

Development happens in the `develop` branch. Please issue pull requests against `develop`. The `master` branch is supposed to kept at the least, more or less stable release.

This project targets Python 3 exclusively. Python 3.4 support is optional and can be dropped if required. Python 3.5 and later are mandatory as Python 3.5 is still widely used and supported. The primary target is CPython, although PyPy support is welcome.
