# How to contribute to *refuse*

Thank you for considering contributing to *refuse*!
**Contributions are highly welcomed!**

Development happens in the `develop` branch. Please issue pull requests against `develop`. The `master` branch is supposed to kept at the least, more or less stable release.

This project targets Python 3 exclusively. Python 3.4 support is optional and can be dropped if required. Python 3.5 and later are mandatory as Python 3.5 is still widely used and supported. The primary target so far is CPython, although PyPy support is highly welcome.

If you are planning on working on a "larger" issue or feature, please add yourself to the corresponding issue on GitHub or create a new one there - before you start working. This helps to reduce duplicate effort and allows to coordinate developers.
